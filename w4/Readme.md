### Q1 Does SMO do better than the random baselines?
* Ans When comparing the performance of SMO (Print statement 6) with the random baseline (Print statements 1, 2, 4) we can say that the performance of SMO is better, as it is observed to have consistently better Y values (For auto93 less weight and more accelaration and mpg) when compared to the random baselines.

### how many y row evaluations are required for print 3?
* Ans D2H is calculated based on the values of each of the y columns individually, so iterating through the 3 columns of the auto93.csv dataset for each of the 398 rows will give us a total of 1194 y row evaluations to put out print 3.

### how does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)
* Ans SMO does not  perform better than the absolute best, but it get close to the absolute best with less computation.
