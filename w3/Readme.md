- On experimenting with different values of k and m, we observed that the accuracies for the diabetes dataset does not change, whereas for the soybean dataset the m value of 1 (for $k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$) yields the highest accuracies.
- task 3 output has been reported in [diabetes.out](https://github.com/ASE-24-Group-15/Homeworks/blob/main/w3/diabetes.out)
- task 4 output has been reported in [soybean.out](https://github.com/ASE-24-Group-15/Homeworks/blob/main/w3/soybean.out)
- task 4 additional output report of exploring the low frequency settings has been reported in [diabetes-elfs.out](https://github.com/ASE-24-Group-15/Homeworks/blob/main/w3/diabetes-elfs.out)
